# Teams Bot Telemetry - Complete Query Pack

This folder contains **30 KQL files** organized by category. These queries are deployed as an **Azure Monitor Query Pack** for efficient management and sharing.

## üéØ What is a Query Pack?

Query Packs are Azure's modern approach for managing and sharing KQL queries:
- **Bulk Deployment**: All 30 queries deployed as a single unit
- **Better Organization**: Logical grouping with categories and tags  
- **Version Control**: Integrated with Infrastructure as Code
- **Easy Sharing**: Can be shared across workspaces and teams
- **Reliability**: Avoids timeout issues with individual query deployment

## üìä Query Categories

### üë• User Analytics (`users/`)
- **Active Users**: Daily and hourly user activity
- **User Engagement**: Interaction patterns and behavior
- **Peak Usage**: Usage patterns by time of day

### ‚ö° Performance Monitoring (`performance/`)

### üîç Debugging (`debugging/`)
- **Recent Errors**: Latest issues for troubleshooting
- **Trace Correlation**: Correlate traces by operation and conversation

## üöÄ Deployment

### Deploy Query Pack
```powershell
cd infra
.\deploy-query-pack.ps1
```

This will:
1. Auto-detect settings from `env/.env.dev`
2. Deploy the Query Pack to your Azure subscription
3. Make all queries available in Azure Monitor

## üìç Accessing Your Queries

After deployment, find your queries at:

1. **Azure Portal** ‚Üí **Monitor** ‚Üí **Query Packs**
2. **Log Analytics Workspace** ‚Üí **Logs** ‚Üí **Query explorer**
3. Look for: `{resourceBaseName}-telemetry-queries`

## üé® Using the Queries

1. Navigate to your **Application Insights** resource
2. Go to **Logs** 
3. Open **Query explorer** (folder icon)
4. Find your **Query Pack** in the explorer
5. Click any query to load it into the editor
6. Run the query to see your telemetry data

## üìù Manual Usage (Alternative)

You can also copy individual `.kql` files directly:
1. Open any `.kql` file in this folder
2. Copy the KQL content  
3. Paste into Application Insights **Logs** query editor
4. Run the query

## üîß Infrastructure as Code

The Query Pack is deployed via:
- **`infra/queryPack.bicep`** - Query Pack template with 8 essential queries
- **`infra/azure.bicep`** - Main template (set `deployTelemetry=true`)
- **`infra/deploy-query-pack.ps1`** - Standalone deployment script

## üìä Sample Queries Included

The Query Pack includes these pre-configured queries:
- Bot Activity Overview
- Message Processing Success Rate  
- SSO Authentication Events
- Error Rate Monitoring
- Response Time Distribution
- Active Users
- Application Lifecycle
- Recent Errors (Last 24h)

## üéØ Next Steps

1. **Deploy the Query Pack**: Run `.\deploy-query-pack.ps1`
2. **Access in Portal**: Monitor ‚Üí Query Packs  
3. **Start Monitoring**: Use the pre-built queries
4. **Customize**: Modify queries as needed for your specific monitoring requirements
2. **Run queries**: Paste into Application Insights > Logs and execute

### Automated Deployment to Azure (Using Dev Environment)
The scripts automatically use your dev environment settings from `env\.env.dev`:

**Windows PowerShell:**
```powershell
# Run the PowerShell script (uses dev environment automatically)
.\publish-queries-to-insights.ps1
```

**Windows Batch:**
```batch
# Simple batch file that calls PowerShell
.\publish-queries-to-insights.bat
```

**Cross-platform Bash:**
```bash
# Make executable and run
chmod +x publish-queries-to-insights.sh
./publish-queries-to-insights.sh
```

All scripts will:
- ‚úÖ Load configuration from your `env\.env.dev` file
- ‚úÖ Parse your Application Insights connection string  
- ‚úÖ Automatically find your Azure resources
- ‚úÖ Publish all 30+ queries to Application Insights with separate categories:
  - **TeamsBotTelemetry-Core** - Essential bot metrics
  - **TeamsBotTelemetry-Users** - User analytics  
  - **TeamsBotTelemetry-Performance** - Performance monitoring
  - **TeamsBotTelemetry-Errors** - Error analysis
  - **TeamsBotTelemetry-Advanced** - Business intelligence
  - **TeamsBotTelemetry-Debugging** - Data exploration
- ‚úÖ Provide direct Azure portal links to access the published queries

### Getting Started
3. **Start with debugging**: Use debugging queries first to understand your data structure

## üîç Finding Your Saved Queries in Azure Portal

### Step-by-Step Navigation:
1. **Open Azure Portal**: Go to [portal.azure.com](https://portal.azure.com)
2. **Find Your Application Insights**: 
   - Search for "Application Insights" in the top search bar
   - Select your Application Insights resource (from your dev environment: `devops-ai-rg` resource group)
3. **Navigate to Logs**:
   - In the left sidebar, click **"Logs"** under the "Monitoring" section
4. **Access Saved Queries**:
   - In the Logs interface, look for **"Saved Queries"** in the left panel
   - Expand the saved queries section
5. **Find Your Categories**:
   - Look for categories starting with **"TeamsBotTelemetry-"**:
     - üìä **TeamsBotTelemetry-Core** - Essential bot metrics
     - üë• **TeamsBotTelemetry-Users** - User analytics  
     - ‚ö° **TeamsBotTelemetry-Performance** - Performance monitoring
     - üö® **TeamsBotTelemetry-Errors** - Error analysis
     - üìà **TeamsBotTelemetry-Advanced** - Business intelligence
     - üîç **TeamsBotTelemetry-Debugging** - Data exploration

2. **Click "Run"** to execute the query
3. **Customize** time ranges and filters as needed
4. **Pin to Dashboard** for ongoing monitoring

## Tips

- Start with `debugging/basic-data-check.kql` to verify data is flowing
- Use `debugging/span-names.kql` to see what events you're tracking
- Core metrics in `core/` folder are essential for daily monitoring
- Advanced analytics provide business insights
